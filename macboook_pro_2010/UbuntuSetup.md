### Overview

This is essentially my compilation and paraphrasing of all the resources that I found online which were useful in setting up Ubuntu (specifically 16.04 although other versions should also work) on my mid 2010 macbook pro 7,1. Since it is a bit tricky and there are various pitfalls such as graphics card driver issues and WiFi driver issues, I need this information at one place.
