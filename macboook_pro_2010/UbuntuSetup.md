# Ubuntu 16.04 setup on macbook pro 7,1 (mid 2010 model)

### Overview

This is essentially my compilation and paraphrasing of all the resources that I found online which were useful in setting up Ubuntu (sepcifically 16.04 altough other versions should also work) on my mid 2010 macbook pro 7,1. Since it is a bit treaky and there are various pitfalls such as graphics card driver issues and wifi driver issues, I need this information at one place.
